# Film industry analysis for Microsoft corporation

## This a data science project for analyzing market trends of film industry written using python language
 This project is an example that was built along with python and its libraries showing how to analyze a film market trend 
 using past data records from sales and performance of movies in the box office. Every sample code in this project shows
 how to perform and execute the following;
  * Loading data sets usings pandas python library.
  * Cleaning data sets.
  * Using clean data to derive business insights.
  * Merging of different datasets.
  * Plotting visuals like graphs to understand realationships between variables.
## Data
 To generate revenue based trends and data we used data from www.the-numbers.com which provides detailed movie financial analysis, including box office, DVD and Blu-ray sales reports, and release schedules. We will be focusing primarily on box office earnings to comment on industry trends.

This report also utilizes www.imdb.com and rottentomatoes.com. among other movie sites and recoreds. The former being an indicator of popularity of various titles using a review and rating system, and the latter being a review aggregator as posted by critics. We shall employ these sites to see what genres are popular by both regular viewers and critics.


## Tools and platforms
This report utilizes pandas , numpy, seaborn,matplotlib and sql as our primary data tools to analyse datas as well as visualizations.


## Visualizations
  Using libraries mentioned above , I have created meaningful graphs to help us identify relationship between two or more variables
  Here are some visuals for you;
    * relationship between rating and runtime using scatterplot.

      here we are checking for correlation between the two variables
    * Another visual is a timeseries plot against popularity

      It explains how popularity of movies behave as time goes by.
## Developer instructions
  If you are intrested in interacting with this data or you want to do more analysis about the problem under study, 
  you can clown this repository and work on it on your machine. You can use the https link or the SSH to clone or fork this 
  repository for your own study.
  On your local machine you can install anaconda software to help you set up an environment in order to access all the libraries 
  you will need to undertake this project.
## Contributor expectations
 While interracting with the sample codes in the notebook, if you encounter any error while debugging the code please solve it in order
 to avoid repeating the same error. Also feel free to dig for more insights from the data that is worthwhile to an organisation.
